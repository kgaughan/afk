Code Quality:

 * Full test suite. Currently there's none, which really chafes.

 * Further decoupling. One of the aims of AFK is that its various components
   should be usable separately from the rest in so far as is possible without
   making the compilation as a whole difficult to use together.


Documentation:

 * Documentation should be converted to LaTeX.

 * Individual modules need to be documented more thoroughly.

 * The tutorial needs to be completed.

 * Make sure the class documentation is compatible with PhpDocumentor.


Extra Libraries:

 * Support for writing long-running single-threaded and multiprocess servers.


Packaging:

 * Make it installable with PEAR.
